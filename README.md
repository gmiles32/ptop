# ptop
## Background
I've had a fascination with TUI programs for awhile now. It's just about the nerdiest thing someone could make. I guess this
means that I am a nerd. The purpose of this project is to create a fun `top` program for myself, with a biochemistry twist.
Essentially, on top of reporting CPU usage and temp, along with memory usage, I also want to incorporate ASCII art of
some interesting proteins, along with some facts about the proteins. That way I can monitor my PC and be graced by the wonders
of biochemistry!

## Features/Gameplan
- [ ] Produce ASCII art from images/movies
- [ ] Generate movies from 20 proteins
- [ ] Implement CPU monitoring (with graphs)
- [ ] Implement task view
- [ ] Choose to have protein movie or stationary image
